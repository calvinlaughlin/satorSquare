# satorSquare
From Wikipedia:
The Sator Square (or the Rotas-Sator Square, or the Templar Magic Square) is a two-dimensional acrostic class of word square containing a five-word Latin palindrome. The earliest squares have been found at several Roman-era sites in ROTAS-form, with the earliest discovery at Pompeii (likely pre-A.D 62). The squares in SATOR-form have been found from the fourth century, and the first definitively Christian-associated squares date from the sixth century; by late medieval times they were common across Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa. Encyclopedia Britannica called it "the most familiar lettered square in the Western world".
